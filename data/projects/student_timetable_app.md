Timetable is an app to help students manage their busy schedules.

For students always late to class, Timetable reminds you of your classes X
minutes before they start, configurable in Settings. Forgetful students can keep
on top of their assignments using the sorted list, colour-coded by subject.
Notifications are displayed for overdue or incomplete assignments, and once
you're done, you can swipe them off the list.
